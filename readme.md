# where to skate

The whereto**skate** project is an educational project to improve my JavaScript and experiment with some new tools (Firebase, Travis).

## End Goal

You will be able to order UK ice rinks by distance from your current location. The app will make use of geolocation, service workers, and will behave like a native app where possible.

## Performance

I have set a target of 95+ with Google's PSI.

## Feedback

I would love feedback! Please raise an issue if I could do something better. Thanks! :)
